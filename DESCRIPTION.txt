Logic of the game:

The player is a cat and the obstacles are the sprays. The sprays are moving towards the cat.
If a cat and the spray are in the same cell, there is a collision and a player loses life.
Generally, there are 3 lives, but the game is endless so even if you lost all your lives
you can still continue the game.
The player has 2 options: move left or move right.
If the player is in the last cell on the right or left, he/she cannot go out of the screen limits,
no matter how many times you press the button.
You can collide with the spray horizontally by moving the cat to spray or vertically,
if the spray "falls" on you.
When there is a crash, there is a vibration and a toast message.
